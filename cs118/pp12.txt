Lab 12-Reading an integer from the keyboard

Create a subroutine to read an integer from the keyboard.  Return that integer in eax.

Here is logic to convert the user's input to an integer (numvalue in this case):

     Initialize an integer to 0.  I called this integer numvalue.  (This will contain the result.)
     Loop while next user digit is not 10
          Get next user digit
          Convert that digit from ASCII to an actual digit.  (Subtract 48 from the digit)
          Multiply numvalue by 10 and add the new digit to the result.
          Store that result back in numvalue.

File: keyboard.asm

Problems:

22          movl %ebx, numvalue   # Store result back in numvalue
(gdb) i r ecx ebx
ecx            0x5                 5
ebx            0x3039              12345
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, loop () at keyboard.asm:24
24          jmp loop              # Continue loop
(gdb) c
Continuing.
6

Breakpoint 3, loop () at keyboard.asm:20
20          addl %ecx, %ebx       # Add new digit
(gdb)
Continuing.

Breakpoint 4, loop () at keyboard.asm:22
22          movl %ebx, numvalue   # Store result back in numvalue
(gdb) i r ecx ebx
ecx            0x406               1030
ebx            0x1e640             124480

MG: ecx stored 6 where did 4 come from?
