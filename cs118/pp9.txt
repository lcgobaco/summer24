Lab 9-"Print" the value in a register as a decimal number, one digit at a time

Store an integer in any 32-bit register.  Create a loop that "displays" the digits of that number.  The word "displays" means to calculate the digits and convert them into ASCII, and then to print the ASCII.  (To convert a digit to ASCII, add 48 to it.)

Here is an algorithm to use:

Calculate digits and push them onto the stack
Also, count how many digits there are
   counter = 0
   next_digit
        Calculate number mod 10    Add 48 (decimal) and push that onto stack
        Calculate number div 10    Store this back into number
        counter ++
        if number > 0 then goto next_digit

Print the digits
   while
        pop
        "Print" what was popped
        decrement counter
        if counter > 0 then goto while
