Lab 11-Converting our code into a subroutine

Copy your code from Programming Assignment 9 into a new file.  Then convert that code into a subroutine.  The subroutine should receive a number in eax and then print it.  In your main, use at least two numbers to test.  Also, from now on, exit gracefully into the operating system at the end of your program.
