Lab 14-Passing arguments to a subroutine

Do either Part a (easier) or Part b (harder)

Part a.

Change your code that prints an integer.
Instead of printing the value in eax, push the value onto the stack as an argument and print that.

Part b.

Similar to Part a, put an argument on the stack.
This time the argument is a pointer to an int.
 The subroutine should increment the value that the argument points to.
